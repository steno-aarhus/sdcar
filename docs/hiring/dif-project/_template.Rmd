The [Department of Clinical Medicine](https://clin.au.dk/) at 
[Faculty of Health](https://health.au.dk/en/) at Aarhus University, in collaboration 
with the [Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) (SDCA),
invites applications for `r number_of_positions` as "`r details$title`" to work 
(largely remote) with a team
on a recently funded software and data infrastructure project, starting 
`r details$start_date` or as soon as possible thereafter. `r details$duration`

At the Department of Clinical Medicine, you will be part of what is probably the
largest health science research department in Denmark. Our clinical research
covers all the medical specialties and takes place in close collaboration with
the university hospital and the regional hospitals in the Central Denmark
Region. At the department we are approximately 425 academic employees and the
same number of PhD students cooperating across disciplines. 

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an aim to
better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment, research, and
education. 

This project aims to build an open and scalable data infrastructure framework
(DIF) for working with, discovering, and managing data that follows FAIR and
open science principles. This is a *software* project that focuses on
working with data, but not on data itself. A description of the DIF project can
be found at https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/.
The DIF project will be contributing to the research of SDCA
(https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/) as well as that of other
Steno centers and research initiatives throughout Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current position and the rest of the DIF team, have a
direct and impactful influence on how the culture and infrastructure is built
and developed. Aside from working on the DIF project, other responsibilities for
the `r details$title`, as well as the rest of the team, include contributing
to this (explicit and inclusive) culture, for instance by adding to our Common
Docs (https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/).

## Your job responsibilities

```{asis, echo=params$position == "rse"}
As the research software engineer, you will be:

- Building and developing RESTful APIs (or APIs in general) for the DIF

- Reviewing contributed code and documentation text

- Assisting with or developing tools for improving analysis and workflow
pipelines related to using the DIF (e.g. making Python/R packages and scripts)

*Note*, we anticipate that work on the DIF project will not take up all
full-time work, so depending on the applicant's interest, we encourage and support
the research software engineer to collaborate on research projects outside of
the project time.
```

```{asis, echo=params$position == "tl"}
As the team leader, you will be:

- Planning, coordinating, and if necessary revising the tasks required to
complete the DIF project

- Tracking milestones and managing issues that may arise so that work on the DIF
project continues as smoothly as possible

- Creating a welcoming and collaborative environment

- Reviewing contributed code and documentation text, accepting changes made

- Facilitating, communicating, and coordinating with the team members on
completing the DIF project tasks

- In addition to the DIF project tasks, you are expected and encouraged to perform
independent research activities, and time for this will be prioritized together
with the primary investigator
```

```{asis, echo=params$position == "dba"}
As the database administor, you will be:

- Building up the core architecture of the DIF SQL database (e.g. as a data warehouse)

- Developing interfaces between the end users and the SQL database

- Tracking and managing how the DIF project may use server resources

Additional tasks you may also do include:

- Providing support for running projects with "Forskermaskine" (research engine
on Statistics Denmark or Sundhedsdatastyrelsen)

- Communicating and coordinating with Statistics Denmark to refine how the DIF
project may be implemented

*Note*, we anticipate that work on the DIF project will not take up all
full-time work, so depending on the applicant's interest, we encourage and support
pursuing their own or collaborating on other projects outside of the project
time.
```

```{asis, echo=params$position == "dm"}
As the data manager, you will be:

- Mapping out the various DD2 sources of data, documentation, and resources, and plan 
out steps to implement the DIF project

- Writing up documentation and provide support for working with "Forskermaskine" 
(research engine on Statistics Denmark or Sundhedsdatastyrelsen) projects

- Acting as liaison between the various DD2 centers and the DIF team, including
to coordinate and manage implementing the DIF project
```

### Team-wide responsibilities

The **primary** responsibility for all members of the DIF team will be
building and developing the newly started DIF project. For a general overview
of timelines and tasks, see the Gantt chart in the project description 
(https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/#deliverables-and-milestones)
More specifically, tasks will include:

- Refining, critiquing, and improving on the descriptions of the use-cases and 
the design and architecture of the DIF

- Finding and reviewing similar projects to identify what to use and what can be
improved upon

- Building, internally testing, and developing each component of the DIF into
Minimally Valuable Products for early external testing and refining

- Writing public-facing, *beginner-friendly*, and accessible documentation on
contributing to and using the DIF

- Creating and maintaining websites connected to the DIF (e.g. through
GitHub Pages)

All team members' *secondary* responsibilities (dependent on time available
outside of the DIF project):

- Contributing to tasks and projects related to the general administration or
building up of the general research environment (e.g. writing and/or updating
onboarding documentation)

- Assisting with building up general capacity and skills in
reproducibility/transparency of research data analyses

- Creating and running training sessions related to the DIF and to general
computational analysis skills

*Note*, while the team as a whole will need to complete these tasks, any
individual member of the team *does not* need to do all these tasks and instead
will be assigned specific sections of the project.

You will report to the Unit Head Annelli Sandb√¶k and to the team leader.

## Your competencies

We expect, at a minimum, that you:
