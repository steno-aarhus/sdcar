The [Department of Clinical Medicine](https://clin.au.dk/) at [Faculty
of Health](https://health.au.dk/en/) at Aarhus University, in
collaboration with the [Steno Diabetes Center
Aarhus](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) (SDCA), invites applications for a
position as a team leader to work with a team on a recently funded
software and data infrastructure project, starting May 1 or as soon as
possible thereafter. The position is a fixed-term full-time position for
5 years.

At the Department of Clinical Medicine, you will be part of what is
probably the largest health science research department in Denmark. Our
clinical research covers all the medical specialties and takes place in
close collaboration with the university hospital and the regional
hospitals in the Central Denmark Region. At the department we are
approximately 425 academic employees and the same number of PhD students
cooperating across disciplines.

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an
aim to better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment,
research, and education.

This project aims to build an open and scalable data infrastructure
framework (DIF) for working with, discovering, and managing data that
follows FAIR and open science principles. This is largely a *software*
project that focuses on working with data, but not on data itself. A
description of the DIF project can be found at
<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/>. The DIF project will be
largely contributing to the research of SDCA
(<https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/>) as well as that of other Steno
centers and research initiatives throughout Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current position and the rest of the DIF team,
have a direct and impactful influence on how the culture and
infrastructure is built and developed. Aside from working on the DIF
project, other responsibilities for the team leader, as well as the rest
of the team, include contributing to this (explicit and inclusive)
culture, for instance by adding to our Common Docs
(<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/>).

## Your job responsibilities

### Team-wide responsibilities

The **primary** responsibility for all members of the DIF team will be
building and developing the newly started DIF project. For a general
overview of timelines and tasks, see the Gantt chart in the project
description
(<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/#deliverables-and-milestones>)
More specifically, tasks will include:

-   Refining, critiquing, and improving on the descriptions of the
    use-cases and the design and architecture of the DIF
-   Finding and reviewing similar projects to identify what to use and
    what can be improved upon
-   Building, internally testing, and developing each component of the
    DIF into Minimally Valuable Products for early external testing and
    refining
-   Writing public-facing, *beginner-friendly*, and accessible
    documentation on contributing to and using the DIF
-   Creating and maintaining websites connected to the DIF (e.g. through
    GitHub Pages)

All team members’ *secondary* responsibilities (dependent on time
available outside of the DIF project):

-   Contributing to tasks and projects related to the general
    administration or building up of the general research environment
    (e.g. writing and/or updating onboarding documentation)
-   Assisting with building up general capacity and skills in
    reproducibility/transparency of research data analyses
-   Creating and running training sessions related to the DIF and to
    general computational analysis skills

*Note*, while the team as a whole will need to complete these tasks, any
individual member of the team *does not* need to do all these tasks and
instead will be assigned specific sections of the project.

### Team leader responsibilities

As the team leader, you will be:

-   Planning, coordinating, and if necessary revising the tasks required
    to complete the DIF project
-   Tracking milestones and managing issues that may arise so that work
    on the DIF project continues as smoothly as possible
-   Creating a welcoming and collaborative environment
-   Reviewing contributed code and documentation text, accepting changes
    made
-   Facilitating, communicating, and coordinating with the team members
    on completing the DIF project tasks
-   In addition to the DIF project tasks, you are expected and
    encouraged to perform independent research activities, and time for
    this will be prioritized together with the primary investigator

## Your competencies

We expect, at a minimum, that *all team members*:

-   Have worked on, started, or contributed to open source projects on
    open sharing and collaborative platforms (e.g. Open Science
    Framework, GitHub, GitLab)
-   Have used Git or other version control software on a fairly regular
    basis for projects
-   Are proficient in communicating (written and oral) in English
-   Are motivated, interested, and comfortable with working on projects
    that have recently started and that require contributing to a
    diverse set of tasks typical of the early stages of any initiative

And we prefer, but don’t require, that you:

-   Have knowledge of and familiarity with *general* software
    development practices
-   Are interested in or motivated to be involved in aspects of building
    up and developing the culture and infrastructure of a newer
    organization
-   Have knowledge of and experience in implementing and adhering to
    FAIR principles

As the *team leader*, we expect you to:

-   Have experience in managing and coordinating projects and people
-   Have demonstrated knowledge of and experience in using R and/or
    Python for scientific data analysis and research software
    development
-   Have knowledge of and proficient in general research practices and
    working with and managing big data
-   Have demonstrated experience in, actively involved in, and
    passionate advocate for open scientific practices
-   Be competent in writing beginner-friendly documentation and in
    developing (and teaching) educational material in data analysis and
    open science
-   Be a skilled researcher with a PhD in health science and are
    familiar with register data

## Who we are/will be

We will be building up the core team so that in the end we will be two
full-time research software engineers (one 5 year and one 2 year
positions), a data manager, a database administrator, a team leader, as
well as affiliate researchers and the primary investigator. We think
we’re a fun and relaxed group, and we have a great working environment
and colleagues :)
<!-- External collaborators include 2-3 data managers and coordinators as well as -->
<!-- consultant software engineers. -->

## What we offer

-   The position can be partly remote. We prefer that you come into the
    office at least twice a week.

-   The working hours are very flexible.

-   Any necessary hardware or software will be provided or covered for.

## Contact information

-   If you have any specific questions about the position, **contact**
    Annelli Sandbæk (<anesnd@rm.dk>).

## Formalities and salary range

-   Salary is competitive and aligns with agreements between the
    university and the national unions.
